# Testing blog post

This is a post that has as a purpose to test whether jekyll basics is working succesfully. This is the first time I use this layout so maybe this could be a mess, however we are wishing all the best.

In the other hand, I would likely start to post things like a parrot. Just to practice my writing skills.

También sería bueno escribir en español, pero de eso me encargaré después.

Now you can add code:

```bash
ls -lth /path/to/folder
```

Tables:

| Mathjax | Emojis |
| $$E=mc^{2}$$ | :exploding_head: |

Setting up things here could be easier.
