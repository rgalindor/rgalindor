# Testing blog post

This is a post that has as a purpose to test whether jekyll basics is working succesfully. This is the first time I use this layout so maybe this could be a mess, however we are wishing all the best.

In the other hand, I would likely start to post things like a parrot. Just to practice my writing skills.

También sería bueno escribir en español, pero de eso me encargaré después.

Saludos
