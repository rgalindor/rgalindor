Human beings have had to try to understand the universe since the beginning of history. Now we have some cool tools to prove our knowledge, a great example is the scientific method, but that was not always the same.

At the init of times, humanity tended to use assumptions to try to understand the world. With the ease of years, philosophers start to appear and with them their thoughts. In the renaissance, some statements were coined, some of them remain useful until our days. To understand the universe was proposed a series of statements:

- Do not admit any fact as true until having evidence to support it.
- Divide complex ideas. Whether they are difficult to understand, it is valuable to reduce sentences through consequences until arriving at known proposals.
- Drive with order your thoughts, starting with the simplest to the hardest. Suppose an order even though it is unknown.
- Record anything, be sure do not to forget anything in the review when you arrive at a conclusion.

These are the foundations of the scientific method, which has contributed a lot to the development of science. However, at this time they could be viewed as reductionist, maybe they need to be adjusted in some way in the light of complex systems study.
