_Senior Bioinformatician and Data Scientist_ 

I studied in a Mexican [undergraduate program for **genomic sciences**](https://www.lcg.unam.mx) and in a [master's program in biochemical sciences](http://www.mdcbq.posgrado.unam.mx) (but more oriented to **computational biology**). I have focused into inquire how certain properties in a network are related to dynamical features in different systems like transcriptional regulatory network on yeast or simulations of boolean networks of B cell differentiation models.

Then I suddenly became a **bioinformatician**, at the beginning building procedures to detect **GMOs** with **NGS** data, but later I got deeper in human genomics of genetic associated diseases. I have automated processes for high-quality **variant calling** and contributed to the creation of web applications for direct customer operation in this type of analysis. I even led a developing team for genetic reporting and continuously implemented **ML on classification** projects using variant population data. 

I am a huge fan of **Futbol** (yeah in spanish for soccer ⚽), I really like to watch every 4 years the FIFA world cup!

I work with genomic data, processing it to obtain relevant biological information that can be converted later into knowledge. I have experience with high-quality variant calling with human **sequencing/microarray data**, **ancestry** estimations, **GWAS** studies, and clinical **annotation of variants**. I also have worked with bulk **RNA seq** data as well as microarray data to obtain **differential expression profiling** and **_de novo_ assembly** of transcriptomes.  

I like to learn technical skills around the IT industry (but not so deep). I use programming languages as tools to arrange data in ways that became easier to get insights into valuable information. I regularly use `Perl`, `awk` and `R` for that scope, however, in the last months I've also made some advances in learning `Python`, `SQL`, and `Go`.

I want to contribute to global projects on bioinformatics, looking for interesting patterns with different types of technologies. I still want to know how functions emerge in **complex systems** from different types of structures. Eventually, I would like to use this knowledge to improve the life of people systematically oppressed because of this improvable social system.

Let's talk about science, data, genomics and complex systems.
