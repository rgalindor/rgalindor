_Senior Bioinformatician and Data Scientist_ 

I studied in a Mexican undergraduate program for genomic sciences and in a master's program in biochemical sciences (but more oriented to computational biology). I have focused into inquire how certain properties in a network are related to dynamical features in different systems like transcriptional regulatory network on yeast or simulations of boolean networks of B cell differentiation models.

Then I suddenly became a bioinformatician, at the beginning building procedures to detect GMOs with NGS data, but later I got deeper in human genomics of genetic associated diseases. I even led a developing team and continuously implemented ML on classification projects.

I like to learn technical skills around IT industry (but not so deep). I use programming languages as tools to arrange data in ways that became data easier to get insights of valuable information. I regularly use `Perl`, `awk` and `R` for that scope, however in the last months I've also made some space for `Python`, `SQL` and `Go`.
