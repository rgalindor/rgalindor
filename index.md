_Senior Bioinformatician and Data Scientist_ 
I studied in a mexican undergraduate program for genomic sciences and in a master program in biochemical sciences (but more oriented to computational biology). I have focused into deveal how certain properties in a network are related to dynamical features in different systems like transcriptional regulatory network on yeast or simulations of boolean networks of b cell differentiation models.
Then I suddenly became a bioinformatician, at the beginning building procedures to detect GMOs with NGS data, but later I got deeper in human genomics of genetic associated diseases. I even led a developing team and continuosly implemented ML on classification projects.
